== Description ==

Allows payments to be made into your Blockchain.info wallet. No other third-party.
Take Bitcoin payments without paying comission or fees.

> **Requires: WooCommerce 2.1+**

This plugin clones the Cheque gateway to create another offline payment method. This can be used to create a testing payment method if you use the Cheque gateway for something else. For example, this could be used for manual invoices or other offline payment methods.
